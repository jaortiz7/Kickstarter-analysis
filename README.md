# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### How different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Wanted to show the relationship between outcomes and launch date by month for the theater kickstarter's. I created a pivot table to show the count of successful, failed, and cancel theater kickstarter's including all the years that data is available for. The graph below shows the failed and canceled outcomes stay flat throught out the year, while the summer month's May, June, and July are the month with the best chance of having a successful theater kicktarter.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
the analysis only took place for theater while we could have done the same type of analysis but for all kickstarter's.
