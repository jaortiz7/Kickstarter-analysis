# Fundraising Analysis

## Vizualization on how the theater campaigns faired in relation to their launch date and goals. The analysis will help Louise to plan for future theater campaigns for a better chance of being successful.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Wanted to show the relationship between outcomes and launch date by month for the theater kickstarter's. I created a pivot table to show the count of successful, failed, and cancel theater kickstarter's including all the years that data is available for. The graph below shows the failed and canceled outcomes stay flat throught out the year, while the summer month's May, June, and July are the month with the best chance of having a successful theater kicktsarter.

We could compared this theater trend shown with other parent category trends to see if the summer month's are also when those campaigns are most succesful or if this only holds true to theater.


### Outcomes Based on Goals
Wanted to sow the reltionship between percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns and the amount of the goal. This was done by creating a table with a range of the goals by campaing, then I entered formulas to bring intow my table the count of the successful, failed, and canceled campaings. From that point the percentages were calculated. The graph below shows that campaigns with a goal of $4,999 or lest have a 70% or higher chance of being successul. It also shows that once the goal is higher than $20,000 the chances of the campaign failing are over 50%.

With this dataset that I created it would have been useful to bring in the month's that these campaings were ran, as it would have made the analysis even more specific.
